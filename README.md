# Computer structure  
  
After the previous lectures - serving as an introduction - we can now proceed to answering the more general questions:  
  
* What serves which purpose in a computer?  
* What are the subcomponents of a processor?
  
The following lectures will expand some topics appearing on this one (e.g. "how does a computer run a program?"), though they'll also touch other detailed topics.  
  
## Modern integrated circuits  
  
In the lecture "Integrated circuits", we dealt with logic gates and larger digital circuits built from them. In these years, logic gates are esentially no more manufactured as separate products; instead, the smallest building blocks are integrated circuits which combine multiple gates according to a particular application: starting from the simpler ones described in the previous lecture (adders, ?ip-?ops, comparators etc.), through much more complex ones. A typical integrated circuit available in an electronic shop will now look like this:
